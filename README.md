## Motivation
When i started my journey with frontend i tried to get as much knowledge as possible. You probably know a mighty feeling where you must know all the basics and stuff, so you jump from one tutorial to another and then you spend months on it and then you start to write by yourself and you realize you just don't remember what you saw. This challange wasnt my first but it one many (not yet uploaded) i made to understand a basics. I am not totaly proud of the result but whose first projects are perfect :)


## Technologies 
To build this project i used pure CSS and HTML.

## Features 

### Accordion menu with responsive text
Accordion and text is scalable for desktop and laptops. It do not cover a scalable image due to problems with sync of background image and main image.



## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- pseudo class :target

## What I learned

In this project i learned about usage of :target which allows to change values of elements by clicking on link.
